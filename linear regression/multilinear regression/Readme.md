# What Is Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)?
Multiple linear regression (MLR), also known simply as multiple regression, is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. The goal of multiple linear regression is to model the linear relationship between the explanatory (independent) variables and response (dependent) variables. In essence, multiple regression is the extension of ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression because it involves more than one explanatory variable.

#### The multiple regression model is based on the following assumptions:
- there is a linear relationship between the dependent variables and the independent variables
- The independent variables are not too highly correlated with each other
- yi observations are selected independently and randomly from the population
- Residuals should be normally distributed with a mean of 0 and variance Ïƒ

# Steps in MLR
1) Reading and understanding the data.
2) Data Preparation.
3) data visualization.
4) dummy variable creating.
5) building the model.
6) Residual analysis and prediction.
7) variable selection using RFE.
