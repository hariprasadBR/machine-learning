# Linear regression
#### 1) What is Regression?

Regression is a method of modeling a target value based on independent predictors. It is a statistical tool which is used to find out the relationship between the outcome variable also known as the dependent variable, and one or more variable often called as independent variables.  This method is mostly used for forecasting and finding out cause-and-effect relationships between variables. Regression techniques mostly differ based on the number of independent variables and the type of relationship between the independent and dependent variables.

#### 2) When and why do you use Regression?

Regression is performed when the dependent variable is of continuous data type and Predictors or independent variables could be of any data type like continuous, nominal/categorical etc. Regression method tries to find the best fit line which shows the relationship between the dependent variable and predictors with least error. 
In regression, the output/dependent variable is the function of an independent variable and the coefficient and the error term.

#### 3) What is Linear Regression?

The measure of the extent of the relationship between two variables is shown by the correlation coefficient. The range of this coefficient lies between -1 to +1. This coefficient shows the strength of the association of the observed data for two variables.

A linear regression line equation is written in the form of:

Y = a + bX

where X is the independent variable and plotted along the x-axis

Y is the dependent variable and plotted along the y-axis

The slope of the line is b, and a is the intercept (the value of y when x = 0).
